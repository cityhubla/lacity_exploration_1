* R1 Zoning (Source: [LA City Planning GIS Map Gallery](http://planning.lacity.org/mapgallery/mapgallery_gisdata/mapgallerydata.htm))
* C2 Zoning (Source: [LA City Planning GIS Map Gallery](http://planning.lacity.org/mapgallery/mapgallery_gisdata/mapgallerydata.htm))
* Metro Right of Way (Source: [Metro GIS Data Portal](http://developer.metro.net/introduction/metro-row/row-download/))
* Soft Story (Source: [LA Times Acquired LADBS list](http://graphics.latimes.com/soft-story-apartments-needing-retrofit/), joined with [2015 LA County Assessor Data](https://data.lacounty.gov/Parcel-/Assessor-Parcels-Data-2015/hvzm-fn38))

###Discrepancies
* Soft Story Data | The LA Times data says there are 23,059 addresses, many of these are Condos with Unit Numbers of the same address. A joining with the parcel addresses from the LA County Assessor data gave a count of 19,111. These are shown on the map.
